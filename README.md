The first notebook [Planar_data_classification_with_one_hidden_layer](https://github.com/Zahra-Bakhtiari/Building-Deep-Neural-Network-Step-by-Step-Instruction/blob/main/Planar%20data%20classification%20with%20one%20hidden%20layer.ipynb) in this repository covers a simple implementation of a neural network, which will only have one hidden layer. This notebook covers below steps:

1) Implement a 2-class neural network with a single hidden layer

2) Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh

3) Compute the cross entropy loss

4) Implement forward and backward propagation

The second notebook [Building your Deep Neural Network Step by Step](https://github.com/Zahra-Bakhtiari/Building-your-Deep-Neural-Network-Step-by-Step/blob/main/Building_your_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb) in this repository takes it one step further and explains steps to build a deep neural network with as many layers as we want! The model highlights include:

1) Using non-linear units like ReLU to improve your mode
2) Building a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
3) Implementing an easy-to-use neural network class which can easily be integrated into an OOP code base for building complex services.
