# Building-your-Deep-Neural-Network-Step-by-Step

This repository covers building a deep neural network with as many layers as you want! The model highlights includes:

1) Using non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
2) Building a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
3) Implementing an easy-to-use neural network class which is easily integrable with OOP code bases for building complex services by having a deep neural network in the their core.
